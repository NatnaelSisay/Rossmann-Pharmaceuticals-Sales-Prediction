# Rossmann-Pharmaceuticals

## About
There are 1115 locations for the pharmacy chain Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. The finance department of Rossmann Pharmaceuticals aims to predict sales six weeks in advance for all 1115 of its stores spread throughout numerous cities. The data team determined that in order to estimate the sales across different stores, factors including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and geography were crucial. We are creating an end-to-end product for the finance team in this project that will offer this projection to analysts.
